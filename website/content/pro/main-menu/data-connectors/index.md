OpenBB Terminal Pro's Data Connectors are designed to empower teams by allowing them to integrate their own private datasets. This feature enhances the platform's capabilities by providing a seamless experience alongside the data that matters most to you.

We offer three distinct methods for importing your data into the platform.

## No code

This method allows users to import an API endpoint that is directly rendered into a table format. While customization is limited, it provides a quick and easy way to visualize your data. More information can be found here (add link)

## Advanced

For those who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create your own backend. You can either leverage OpenBB's cookie-cutter or build a language-agnostic API. More information can be found here (add link)

## Third-party

OpenBB has established partnerships with several companies to streamline the process of importing external data. This includes data providers that require an API key, or integration with a data warehouse or database. More information can be found here (add link)
