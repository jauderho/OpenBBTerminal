## Introduction

OpenBB Routines allows users to write simple scripts for automating processes and repetitive tasks. In essence, these are text plain-text files that can be created or modified in any basic text editor with the only difference of having a `.openbb` extension.

Other software like STATA, SPSS, and R-Studio share similar functionality in the area of Econometrics and the OpenBB routine scripts venture into the area of financial analysis and data collection to speed up the process.

For example, not only is it possible to automate a set of functionality, but it is also possible to export a large amount of data to Excel through the usage of `--export` and `--sheet-name` making data collection efficient, reproducible and customizable.

The reason for this is the pipeline of commands became increasingly lengthy. This posed a challenge when sharing the commands with colleagues, as it became difficult for them to understand the purpose of the pipeline and what each step aimed to achieve.

## Routine execution

Run a routine file from the main menu, with the `exe` command. A great start would be to use `exe --example` to get a sense of what this functionality does. Below, the `--help` dialogue is displayed.

```console
(ðŸ¦‹) / $ exe -h

usage: exe [--file PATH] [-i ROUTINE_ARGS] [-e] [-h]

Execute the automated routine script. For example, please use `exe --example` and for documentation and to learn how to create your own script type `about exe`.

options:
  --file PATH           The path or .openbb file to run. (default: None)
  -i ROUTINE_ARGS, --input ROUTINE_ARGS
                        Select multiple inputs to be replaced in the routine and separated by commas. E.g. GME,AMC,BTC-USD (default: None)
  -e, --example         Run an example script to understand how routines can be used. (default: False)
  -h, --help            show this help message (default: False)
```

## Basic Script

![image](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/25267873/eaeb3511-d544-4579-8d76-f7a4fd7bb1d3)

The most basic script style contains 2 main elements:

  - **Comments**: any text after a hashtag (`#`) is referred to as a comment. This is used to explain what is happening within the line below and is ignored when the file is executed.

  - **Commands**: any text *without* a hashtag is being run inside the OpenBB Terminal as if the user had prompted that line in the terminal. Note that this means that you are able to create a pipeline of commands in a single line, i.e. `stocks/load AAPL/candle --ma 20` is a valid line for the script.

For instance, the text below corresponds to the example file that OpenBB provides.

```
# Go into the stocks context
stocks

# Load a company ticker, e.g. Apple
load AAPL

# Show a candle chart with a 20 day Moving Average
candle --ma 20

# Switch over to the Fundamental Analysis menu
fa

# Show Earnings per Share (EPS) estimates
epsfc

# Show price targets charts
pt

# Show future estimations
est

# Return to home
home
```

## Getting started

As a starting point, let's use the example above.

1. Create a new text file with the name `routines_template.openbb` and copy and paste the routine above. For simplicity you can also download the template file **[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73g9qx9xgtbb2ec/routines_template.openbb?dl=1)**.

2. Move the file inside the `routines` folder within the [OpenBBUserData](/terminal/usage/data/custom-data) folder and, optionally, adjust the name to your liking.

3. Open up the OpenBB Terminal, and type `exe --file routines_template`. If you changed the name of the file, then replace `routines_template` with such. As long as the file remains in the `routines` folder, you will be able to find your file through OpenBB Terminal's auto-completer capability.

Now you should expect the contents of the example above to be run. This means that a candle chart with a moving average of 20 days, expectations and price targets from analysts and estimated future performance should pop up before returning to the home window.
