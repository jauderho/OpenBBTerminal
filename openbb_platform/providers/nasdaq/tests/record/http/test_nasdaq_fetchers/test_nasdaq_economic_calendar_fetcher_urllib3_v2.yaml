        Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index
        (PMI) Report on Business is based on data compiled from monthly replies to
        questions asked of purchasing and supply executives in over 400 industrial
        companies. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders,
        New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories,
        Customers Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage
        reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses
        in the positive economic direction and the negative economic direction and
        the diffusion index. Responses are raw data and are never changed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
        diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of
        those responding the same (considered positive). The resulting single index
        number is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive
        intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather
        conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable
        to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are supplied by
        the U.S. Department of Commerce and are subject annually to relatively minor
        changes when conditions warrant them. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The PMI is a composite
        index based on the seasonally adjusted diffusion indices for five of the indicators
        with varying weights: New Orders --30% Production --25% Employment --20% Supplier
        Deliveries --15% and Inventories -- 10%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prices
        Paid subcategory is a diffusion index calculated by adding the percent of
        responses indicating they paid more for inputs plus one-half of those responding
        that they paid the same for inputs. The resulting single index number is then
        seasonally adjusted.<BR/><BR/>The Prices Paid diffusion index is one of a
        number of indicators pointing to the degree of inflationary pressures in the
        economy. <br/><br/>\\r\\nA higher than expected reading should be taken as
        positive/bullish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading should be
        taken as negative/bearish for the USD.\"},{\"gmt\":\"11:30\",\"country\":\"United

        goods and services with the cost of the same basket during an earlier benchmark
        period. \\r\\nThe consumer price index is used as a measurement of inflation
        and is a key economic figure. Likely impact: \\r\\n1) Interest Rates: Larger-than-expected
        quarterly increase in price inflation or increasing trend is considered inflationary;
        this will cause bond prices to drop and yields and interest rates to rise.
        \\r\\n2) Stock Prices: Higher than expected price inflation is bearish on
        the stock market as higher inflation will lead to higher interest rates. \\r\\n3)
        Exchange Rates: High inflation has an uncertain effect. It would lead to depreciation
        as higher prices mean lower competitiveness. Conversely, higher inflation
        causes higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy that leads to an
