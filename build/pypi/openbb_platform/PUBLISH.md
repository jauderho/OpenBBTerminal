# Publishing to PyPI

## Pre-release procedure

> [!WARNING]
> The `release` branch is solely for the purpose of publishing the package(s)! Any last minute changes should be made in appropriate PRs and merged to the `develop` branch. Once the `release` branch is created, the `develop` branch should be frozen for further commits.

> A `release` branch for a particular package should only cater to the changes for that package directory. For e.g. the `release/openbb-core-2.0.0` branch should only contain changes for the `openbb-core` package i.e. in the `openbb_platform/core` directory.

### Flow to display only files changes during release cycle in the `release/...` -> `main` PR

1. Merge main into develop before release branch exists, solve any conflict
2. In the branch `release/â€¦` (before or after publishing)
3. `git merge main -X ours` (ignore the changes, we brought them in 1.)
4. `git commit -m "Merge branch 'main' into release/4.2.2"` (empty commit)

### Pre-release checklist

1. Open a PR with the changes to be published in the format `release/<version>` (for e.g. `release/4.0.0` ). For a particular package use the format `release/<package>-<version>` (for e.g. `release/openbb-core-1.0.1`).
2. Ensure all the CI workflows pass.
3. Ensure all unit tests pass: `pytest openbb_platform -m "not integration"`
4. Ensure all integration tests pass: `pytest openbb_platform -m integration`

## Release procedure

> Ensure you have the appropriate credentials and permissions to publish to PyPI.

1. Run the following commands for publishing the packages to PyPI:

    Consider using the `--dry-run` flag to check if everything is correct before publishing.
    Also, it might be a good idea to run the script in batches to ensure that the packages are published correctly and the dependencies pick the correct versions.

    > For a single package release, the following steps are optional since the package can be bumped manually.

    1. For the core package run: `python build/pypi/openbb_platform/publish.py --core`
    2. For the extension packages run: `python build/pypi/openbb_platform/publish.py --extensions`
    3. For the `openbb` package - **which requires manual publishing** - do the following

        3.1. Bump the `openbb` package version and the extension versions on `openbb_platform/pyproject.toml` to the latest version.

        > [!TIP]
        > Consider using the poetry plugin `up` for updating the extensions to the latest version:
        > 1. `poetry self add poetry-plugin-up`
        > 2. `poetry up --latest`

        > [!WARNING]
        > Create a new environment before proceeding.
        > Make sure that only required extensions are installed

        3.2. Run `pip install -e .` from `openbb_platform`

        3.3. Re-build the static assets that are bundled with the package: `python -c "import openbb; openbb.build()"`
        - Run `python -c "import openbb"` after building the static to check that no additional static is being built.
        - Run any command to smoke test if the static assets are being built correctly.

        3.4. Run unit tests to validate the existence of deprecated endpoints (or watch this through GitHub Actions)

        3.5. Run `poetry publish --build` from `openbb_platform`

        3.6. Run `poetry lock` from `openbb_platform`

    > [!TIP]
    > Note that, in order for packages to pick up the latest versions of dependencies, it is advised to clear the local cache of the dependencies:
    >
    > We can do that with `pip cache purge` and `poetry cache clear pypi --all`
    >
    > Also, sometimes there might be some delay in the PyPI API, so it might be necessary to wait a few minutes before publishing the next package.

2. Merge the `release/<package>-<version>` branch to the `main` branch.
3. Check the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` GitHub action is completed successfully. Go to the [docs](https://docs.openbb.co) website to see the changes.

## Post-release procedure

1. Install the packages on Google Colaboratory via PyPi and test to check if everything is working as expected.
2. Install the packages in a new environment locally via PyPi and test to check if everything is working as expected.
3. Regenerate assets for external use by running `python assets/scripts/generate_extension_data.py`
4. Open a new PR with the `release/<package>-<version>` branch pointing to the `develop` branch.
5. Merge the `release/<package>-<version>` branch to the `develop` branch.
6. If any bugs are encountered, create a new branch - `hotfix` for `main` and `bugfix` for `develop` and merge them accordingly.

### Generate the changelog

1. Run the changelog automation by using the "release_drafter" GA and passing the number of the previous Release.
2. Edit and make the changelog live on the repository.
3. Paste it in the platform-release-changelog Slack channel.

### Publish the CLI

1. Bump `openbb` dependency on `cli/pyproject.toml` to the latest version.
2. Run `poetry publish --build` from `cli`
